# Gradebook

## Instructions

* Using `grader.xlsm` as a starting point, create a grade calculator using **conditionals**. This calculator will convert a student's numeric grade into a letter grade, and style the resulting cell accordingly.

* Once complete your script should perform the following:

  * If the score is 90 or over, the student will receive an "A" in the letter grade cell, and the Pass/Warning/Fail cell will be filled green with the text "Pass."

  * If the score is between 80 and 89, the student will receive a "B" in the letter grade cell, and the Pass/Warning/Fail cell will be filled green with the text "Pass." **Note** that the number range is inclusive, so a score of up to 89.9 will fall into the "B" grade range and is not rounded up.

  * If the score is between 70 and 79 (inclusive), the student will receive a "C" in the letter grade cell, and the Pass/Warning/Fail cell will be filled yellow with the text "Warning."

  * Finally, if the score is 70 or below, the student will receive an "F" in the letter grade cell, and the Pass/Warning/Fail cell will be filled red with the text "Fail."

## BONUS

* Create a second button that resets the grades to the original state and then establishes the previous grade in a row labeled "Last Grade."
