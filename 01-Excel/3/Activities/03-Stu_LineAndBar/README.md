# Line and Bar Grades

You are going to take the role of a teacher upon yourself for this activity as you create a series of bar and line graphs that visualize the grades of your class over the course of a semester.

## Instructions

* Create a series of bar graphs that visualize the grades of all students in the class, one graph for every month.

* Create a line graph using all of the data that can be used to compare students' grades across the semester.

  * Use filtering in the line graph to allow you to drill down to a specific student's progress throughout the semester.

### Hint

* When duplicating bar graphs, it pays to get the formatting and look of the chart where you want it for the first graph (e.g. for January), and to then copy that chart and re-select the data for the subsequent copies (keeping the style and format, but just changing the data).
