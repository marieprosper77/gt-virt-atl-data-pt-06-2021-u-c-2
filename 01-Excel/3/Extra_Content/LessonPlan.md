# Extra Content Lesson Plan

## Instructions

The following exercises are available as extra practice or as structured review during office hours.

### 2. Students Do: Excel Warm-Up (0:10)

* If your students are more advanced or feel very comfortable with Excel, feel free to skip this activity and move onto basic charting.

* Before jumping into any new material, lets take the first few minutes of class to do a small warm-up activity so that our students can ease into today's lessons.

* For this warm-up, we are going to be making a basic chart in which we track favorite ice cream flavors. Unlike spreadsheets we have made in the past, however, we are going to be starting this table from scratch using data stored in an external markdown file.

* Slack out [Extra_Stu_IceCreamFaves/README.md](Activities/Extra_Stu_IceCreamFaves/README.md).

### 3. Everyone Do: Excel Warm-Up Review (0:05)

* Open up and slack out [01-Stu_IceCreamFaves/IceCreamFaves_Solved.xlsx](Activities/Extra_Stu_IceCreamFaves/Solved/IceCreamFaves_Solved.xlsx) to your students. Make certain to answer any questions they may have to the best of your ability before moving onto the next section.

* There is nothing new to cover during this review. Simply make sure that the class has a firm understanding of how the number of participants and percentages were found.

* Answer any questions before moving on to the next topic.
