# Ice Cream Flavors

For this warm-up, you are going to be making a basic chart in which you track favorite ice cream flavors. Unlike spreadsheets you have made in the past, however, you are going to be starting this table from scratch.

## Instructions

1. Enter the following values in an Excel spreadsheet:

| Flavor           | Number of Faves |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Vanilla          | 67              |
| Chocolate        | 53              |
| Strawberry       | 64              |
| Mint             | 94              |
| Rocky Road       | 57              |
| Rainbow Sherbert | 79              |
| Butter Pecan     | 96              |
| Cookie Dough     | 41              |
| Coffee           | 34              |
| Neapolitan       | 15              |

2. Create a new cell at the bottom of your table which adds up all of the "Number of Faves" values.

3. Create a new column "Percentage of Total" that you will use to determine what percentage of the total number of favorites a particular ice cream has.

4. Use the "Format as Table" option to make all three columns into a table and then sort by descending order on the "Percentage of Total" column.
