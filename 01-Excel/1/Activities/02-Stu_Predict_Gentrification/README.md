## Predicting Gentrification

This through experiment will discuss gentrification, the social phenomenon by which low-income neighborhoods experience an influx of affluent residents.

### Instructions

* In your groups discuss the following questions:

  * What observable signs can we detect to suggest gentrification is happening?

  * What means can we use to determine how long the trend has been happening?

  * What proxies might we use to identify gentrification in non-obvious ways?

  * How might you create a visualization of this data to best “tell the story”?

* Pay special attention to details like:

  * What data will you use to build your model?

  * How will you retrieve the data?

  * What does your final “story” look like?
