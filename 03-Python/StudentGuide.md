# Unit 3 - Intro to Python

## Overview

In this week we will be introducing the Python programming language. The purpose of this unit is to gain a firm understanding on how to use the core Python language to store and manipulate data; read and write to files; and "translate" logical solutions to problems to Python implementations of those solutions.

This unit will start out with core features of Python, such as variable declarations, and move on to discuss more advanced and idiomatic features of the language. Topics will include reading and writing files, working with the file system, iteration using for loops, iteration using list comprehension, list methods, the notion of dictionaries and methods on them, and additional miscellany where required to facilitate completion of the homework assignment.
