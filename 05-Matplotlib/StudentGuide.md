# Unit 5 - Intro to Matplotlib

## Objectives

* Understand Matplotlib's pyplot interface.
* Be able to create line; bar; scatter; and pie charts.
* Be familiar with basic plot configuration options, such as `xlim` and `ylim`.
* Feel comfortable creating plots using the `DataFrame.plot()` method.
* Understand the advantages and disadvantages of creating charts using the `DataFrame.plot()` method.
* Be able to work through a complex data set using Pandas and then chart some visualizations based upon the cleaned DataFrame.
* Be able to define **mean**, **median**, and **mode**, and choose which one is most appropriate to describe a given data set.
* Be able to explain the meaning of variance and standard deviation.
* Be able to describe standard error and the difference between a sample and a population.
* Be able to add error bars to their plots.
* Be able to fit lines to their data.
