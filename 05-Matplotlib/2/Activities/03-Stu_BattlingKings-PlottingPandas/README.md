# Battling Kings

## Instructions


Your task is to plot the _total_ number of battles each king in the Game of Thrones dataset participated in. In other words, you need to determine how many times each king started a battle _and_ how many times each was a defender.

* Use Pandas to load the `got.csv` dataset.

* Create a series containing the number of times each king was an attacker.

* Create a series containing the number of times each king was a defender.

* Combine these two variables into a single series. (Hint: How should you combine these two series? Can you add series in Pandas?)

* Use your combined data to retrieve labels for your x-axis ticks.

* Create a bar chart with red bars and set its x-axis tick labels appropriately.

* Add a title and labels to your plot.

* Display your plot. Which king participated in the most battles? The least?
